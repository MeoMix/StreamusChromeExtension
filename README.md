Streamus utilizes NodeJS and GruntJS to bundle and package itself for deployment to the Chrome Web Store. You'll need to have both of these pieces of software installed in order to build a distribution of Streamus.

Once installed, simply run "grunt dist:0.103" to generate a distribution zip versioned at v0.103.
